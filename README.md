How does the app work?
- You need to select base and target currency first
- After the two currencies are selected, the exchange rates will be shown and the amount inputs for both currencies will appear.
- When you enter an amount in one of the currencies, the amount of the other currency will be updated immediately.
- In the currency list screen, you can search for a currency based on the code, country and name of the currency.
